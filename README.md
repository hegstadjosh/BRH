### Example knowledge base dict/json structure
knowledge_base_example = {
    "knowledge_base": {
        "title": "BrainButler Knowledge Base",
        "pages": [
            {
                "page_id": "001",
                "title": "Summary",
                "description": "Overview of BrainButler's features and capabilities."
            },
            {
                "page_id": "002",
                "title": "System Architecture",
                "description": "Details on input methods, information processing flow, and AI crews."
            },
            {
                "page_id": "003",
                "title": "Features",
                "description": "List of features including user-controlled page generation and feedback options."
            },
            {
                "page_id": "004",
                "title": "User Interface",
                "description": "Information on the Chrome extension and web app functionalities."
            },
            {
                "page_id": "005",
                "title": "Data Storage",
                "description": "Explanation of how user data, pages, and metadata are stored."
            }
        ]
    }
}

### example page dictionary 
 This dictionary (stores in pinata as json) represents a page in the system. It includes:
 - Page ID: A unique identifier for the page.
 - Title: The title of the page.
 - Content: A brief description or content of the page.
 - Links: An array of pointers to related pages and files. Each link has a type (either 'page' or 'file'), an ID, and a title or filename.
 The frontend can use this dictionary to dynamically fetch and display related content by following the IDs in the links array. This structure allows for easy navigation and organization of interconnected pages and files.

page_example = {
    "page_id": "123",
    "title": "Introduction to BrainButler",
    "content": "This page provides an overview of BrainButler.",
    "links": [
        {
            "type": "page",
            "id": "124",
            "title": "System Architecture"
        },
        {
            "type": "file",
            "id": "file_001",
            "filename": "README.md"
        }
    ]
}
